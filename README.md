## Education

### PSG College of Technology, Coimbatore
- July 16 - May 21, MSc. Data Science (Integrated five year program), GPA: 9.08/10
- Awarded Achievement Award for outstanding curricular, co-curricular and extra-curricular achievements in MSc Data Science class of 2021.
- Organized Machine Learning study group weekly meetings between July 2021 - Nov 2021.

### Deep Forest Science
### Machine Learning Engineer Mar'22 - Present
- Designed and built a maching learning platform for computational drug discovery applications on AWS Batch service.
- Built RestAPIs using FastAPI for submitting jobs to the platform and developed backend services.

#### Indian Institute of Technology, Madras
##### Project Assistant July'21 - Feb'22
I was part of RISE Lab and I worked on various aspects of network security and malware detection in a network. Some key works:
* Developed a high speed network packet sniffer using ring buffer and memory map techniques to capture incoming packets, parsed and collect header fields of packets for performing analysis.
* Built a packet logging application to capture and parse network packets at high speed (tested upto 50 MB/sec) and implemented Bloom Filter algorithm to detect duplicate packets based on packet payload.
* Implemented machine learning algorithm for classifying flows in a network, algorithms to detect suspicious domain names based on DNS patterns
* Studied fingerprinting techniques to detect malicious servers, SSL Inspection of network traffic for malware analysis, detecting user applications by flow features.
* Built a malware detection framework and implemented algorithms for detecting malware from network traffic using predictive modelling techniques.


#### Tata Consultancy Services
##### Research and Development Intern May'19 - Nov'19
- Analyzed time series sales data and built time-series forecasting models for prediction future sales.
- Studied dynamic pricing of interdependent and perishable products using reinforcement learning techniques and proposed a Q-learning model which achieved a yield of 16% higher than passive pricing techniques in simulated environment.

#### in-d.ai
##### Machine Learning Engineering Intern June'20 - July'20
- Developed an AI engine for classifying documents and used NLP techniques for named-entity extraction. The solution was deployed for real-time use using a Flask based web framework.
- Used IAM Handwriting dataset and augmented the dataset to build a robust convolutional netural network for recognizing handwritten words to achieved an accuracy of 64% in recognizing handwritten characters.

#### Mango Education
##### Course Educator April 2020, May 2018
- I was one of the two educator of the course Excel With Sports. In the course, we introduced kids to learn the basic of statistics using Microsoft excel. Kids learnt how to collect and curate data and make visualizations and inferences based on visualizations.
- During May 2018, at Mango, I also conducted a program called "Cricket and Statistics" where kids learnt and explored statistics in different aspects of cricket like team selection, strike rate, economy of players.

## Posters/Workshop papers
### Unpublished Manuscripts
- [Potential Biases in Using Machine Learning for Healthcare Applications](https://Potential Biases in Using Machine Learning for Healthcare Applications), presented at RBCDSAI-FCAI Deployable AI - 2022 conference.
- [Data Driven Analysis of Food Corporation of India's Operations and Recommendations](https://www.arunppsg.in/assets/files/FCI.pdf), presented at as workshop paper for Communications of the ACM Regional Section on India Region, November 2021.

##### Project Maintainer (July 21 - present)
- Implementing machine learning model architectures for enabling quick prototyping and testing of ML
techniques to scientific datasets.
- Improved testing infrastructure and worked on project maintanence like improving code healthiness, creating tutorials, performing code reviews, improving documentation etc


#### TadGAN - [code](https://github.com/arunppsg/tadGAN)
- Created an open source implementaiton of the paper [Time Series Anomaly Detection using Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07769)

#### Packet - Sniffer - [code](https://github.com/arunppsg/packet-sniffer)
- A high speed network packet capture tool using memory mapping and ring buffers for efficiency. The tool can extract meta-data from the packet as well as perform efficient duplicate packet detection using BloomFilter.
