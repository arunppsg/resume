## Education

### PSG College of Technology, Coimbatore
- July 16 - May 21, MSc. Data Science (Integrated five year program), GPA: 9.08/10
-  Awarded Achievement Award for outstanding curricular, co-curricular and extra-curricular achievements in MSc Data Science class of 2021.

## Experience

#### Indian Institute of Technology, Madras
##### Project Assistant July'21 - present
- Built a malware detection framework and implemented algorithms for detecting malware from network traffic using predictive modelling techniques.
- Built a packet logging application to capture and parse network packets at high speed (tested upto 50 MB/sec) and implemented Bloom Filter algorithm to detect duplicate packets based on packet payload.

#### Tata Consultancy Services
##### Research and Development Intern May'19 - Nov'19
- Analyzed time series sales data and built time-series forecasting models for prediction future sales.
- Studied dynamic pricing of interdependent and perishable products using reinforcement learning techniques and proposed a Q-learning model which achieved a yield of 16% higher than passive pricing techniques in simulated environment.

#### in-d.ai
##### Machine Learning Engineering Intern June'20 - July'20
- Developed an AI engine for classifying documents and used NLP techniques for named-entity extraction. The solution was deployed for real-time use using a Flask based web framework.
- Used IAM Handwriting dataset and augmented the dataset to build a robust convolutional netural network for recognizing handwritten words to achieved an accuracy of 64% in recognizing handwritten characters.


## Papers
### Unpublished Manuscripts
##### Data Driven Analysis of Food Corporation of India's Operations and Recommendations - [paper](https://arunppsg.github.io/files/FCI.pdf)
- Collected open data, studied operations of Food Corporation of India and found factors which influence states proposals, efficient utilization of foodgrains and highlighted challenges in providing food security under the current system and suggested policy recommendations.

## Open Source Contributions
#### DeepChem - [PRs](https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem/issues?q=arunppsg+is%3Aclosed)
##### Project Maintainer (July 21 - present)
- Implementing machine learning models based on research papers for applying AI in scientific problems.
- Improved testing infrastructure and worked on project maintanence like improving code healthiness, creating tutorials, performing code reviews, improving documentation etc


#### TadGAN - [code](https://github.com/arunppsg/tadGAN)
- Created an open source implementaiton of the paper [Time Series Anomaly Detection using Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07769)

#### Packet - Sniffer - [code](https://github.com/arunppsg/packet-sniffer)
- A high speed network packet capture tool using memory mapping and ring buffers for efficiency. The tool can extract meta-data from the packet as well as perform efficient duplicate packet detection using BloomFilter.

## Projects
##### Budget Analyzer - [code](https://github.com/arunppsg/budget-analyzer)
- Built an application to keep track of users income and expenses using MongoDb for backend and PyQt for front end. The application gives prediction for future expenses using time-series analysis.
